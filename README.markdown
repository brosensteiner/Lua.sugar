# Lua.sugar

this sugar has the goal to be the ultimate "Lua Espresso Kit" (complete code-sense, navigator view, code folding and syntax highlighting of all Lua built-in functions in the Lua standard library). If someone has suggestions or questions please let me know and [email me](mailto:brosensteiner@gmail.com)

As of the 05.02.2013 Lua 5.2 is fully supported (deprecated functions still "codesensed").

## Installation

Type the following in terminal:

```bash
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Sugars
    git clone git://github.com/brosensteiner/Lua.sugar.git
```
